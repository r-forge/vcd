Both reviewers feel that the paper makes valuable contributions but
that it could be strengthened to make its points more clearly.  Both
reviewers feel that additional examples are needed to illustrate the
points made.  I agree with the second reviewer that side-by-side
graphs illustrating each of the main points you make would greatly
enhance the paper.  These could be based on a single data set or
several data sets.  I also agree with the first reviewer that the UCB
data set is not an ideal illustration.  The amount of fine detail that
the Department A panel seems to suggest can be extracted from one
degree of freedom troubles me as well.

If you choose to undertake a revision, please include detailed
comments to the reviewers indicating the changes you have made, as
well as changes you have not undertaken (with brief justification).
