Dear Luke,

we prepared a revision of our manuscript
  "Residual-based Shadings for Visualizing (Conditional) Independence"
according to your comments and the reviews of the two referees. Please
find attached a completely blinded (title and references), semi-blinded
(only title) and unblinded PDF version of the manuscript. The latter
two also include R code to reproduce the results and figures in the
paper.

The revision encompasses two main changes:

  - side-by-side graphs
    Figure 3 has been extended to illustrate the main points of the 
    paper. It shows both modifications (significance and colors)
    step by step: first a visualization of significance is added,
    then HCL instead of HSV colors are employed.
    This is demonstrated for two different contingency tables using
    a significant maximum-type test and a non-significant sum-of-squares
    test, respectively.

  - conditional independence examples
    The examples for conditional independence models were extended and
    the UCB admissions example was omitted. First, we illustrate a 
    shading corresponding to the double maximum test for a conditional
    4x3 table in 2 strata. Second, we illustrate a shading corresponding
    to the maximum of sum-of-squares test for a conditional 2x2 table
    in 9 (= 3x3) strata. Thus, the double maximum shading is used when
    the focus is on identifying cells in a larger table, and the maximum
    sum-of-squares shading is used when only the stratum can be identified
    (as there is only one degree of freedom in each conditional table,
    as correctly pointed out by the referees).
  
Some more details can be found in the point-to-point answers to the 
referees below.

Best wishes,
Z

The usage of full-color and reduced-color palettes in 2-way tables has
been explained more clearly in Section 3 and two tables are used to 
bring out more clearly the benefits of the new shadings. In particular,
Figure 3 has several side-by-side mosaic plots (with legends) that
compare different shadings for significant and non-significant tests.

In Section 4, a better example (than UCB admissions) has been added that
explains how varying chroma levels can bring out strata-specific
independence.

As already explained above, the examples in Sections 3 and 4 have been
extended (or newly added) to address these points.

This is an interesting point and we have experimented with several
alternative strategies for choosing cut offs for test statistics other
than the maximum. It is rather clear that if we wish to mimic the
behaviour of the maximum shading, the cut offs always have to be outside
the range of residuals for non-significant tests and inside the range
otherwise. The problem is to find cut offs with an intuitive meaning
if other test statistics are used: it is always tempting to classify 
the colored cells as significant (which is only true for the maximum
statistic).

The strategy you describe above sometimes works rather well, but for
some tables it results in rather many colored cells in the plot. To
avoid this, one could always shade a certain share of the cells only.

We have added some discussion of such alternative strategies at the
end of Section 3.

FIXME: Der erste Teil koennte recht defensiv wirken, vielleicht kann
man das noch progressiver formulieren?

%DM% Ich finde, man sagt schon recht klar, dass sein Vorschlag unausgegoren 
     ist, ohne dass er das Gesicht völlig verliert. Ich hätte nur die beiden 
     "rather" weggelassen, das klingt wirklich defensiv.

We have extended Figure 3 for contrasting HSV-based and HCL-based 
shadings (both for the full-color and reduced-color palettes). This
shows in a practical example that the HCL colors are better belanced
and less flashy than the HSV colors from the Friendly shading.

Figure 2 is kept in the paper because it shows that walking along
simple paths through HCL palettes leads to more useful palettes
(in the sense above: balanced, less flashy). As both HSV and HCL
colors can also be represented in RGB (or HSV for that matter),
this is an important point because it is exactly the intuitive
interpretation of the dimensions that makes HCL more useful than
HSV.

For the full-color HCL palettes we have computed the representation
of the colors in HSV space:

HCL		 HSV
(260, 100, 50)   (232.2, 90.9, 76.4)
(260,  50, 72.5) (232.0, 54.7, 81.4)
(  0,	0, 95)   (  0.0,  0.0, 87.4)
(  0,  50, 72.5) (350.8, 59.9, 82.9)
(  0, 100, 95)   (350.7, 92.3, 64.9)

This shows that it would be very hard to choose balanced colors in
HSV space because saturation and value would have to be chosen very
differently for differing hues.

The two new examples in Section 4 have been chosen as to address this
point. It shows how both association and mosaic displays can be 
employed in a trellis layout and how color can bring out both
significance and dependence patterns in these more complex graphs.

It is now pointed out more clearly that conditional inference always
conditions on the observations (i.e., relies on the permutation 
distribution of the test statistics). The term `unconditional limiting
distribution' is used in contrast to the `conditional limiting
distribution'.

FIXME: Dazu habe ich jetzt noch nix gemacht. Das ist nun wirklich extrem
kleinlich, da eh jeder weiss, wie's geht. Ich habe nicht leicht herausfinden
koennen, ob das treatment zufaellig zugewiesen wurde (wuerde dies aber 
vermuten, da es sich um eine Doppel-Blind-Studie handelt). In jedem Fall
moechte ich den Punkt eh nicht diskutieren. Reicht es, wenn wir irgendwo
in Section 2 schreiben, dass Homogenitaet genauso geht?

%DM% ich denke, ja. Kannst ja evtl. noch beim Beispiel in Klammer schreiben, 
     dass das eigentlich der Homogenitätsfall ist - da wollte er sich nur
     wichtig machen.


> page 5, line 3: Standard errors for your p-values?

FIXME: Das ist auch ein bisschen muehsam. Also der Bootstrap-Schaetzer
fuer die Standardabweichung ist (trivialerweise!) einfach
  sqrt(p * (1-p) / 5000)
Muss man ihm das tatsaechlich irgendwohin schreiben? Wenn ja, wie macht
man das, ohne dass es herablassend wirkt?

%DM% Einfach dazu angeben, ohne weiteren Kommentar, und wenn er dann unbedingt
     die Formel will, kann man immer noch eine Fussnote machen.


> page 11, line 6: what does "most similar" mean?

FIXME: Ich habe jetzt `symmetric difference' in die Fussnote geschrieben,
reicht das? Will man dazu mehr sagen? (Ich glaube, dass eigentlich nicht.)

%DM% ich glaube auch nicht, das sprengt den Rahmen. Und das wollte man ja 
     eigentlich in einem anderen paper verarbeiten.

Man koennte auch versuchen, dem Referee eine vollstaendige Antwort zu
geben und im Paper nur etwas vages zu schreiben.

%DM% Man koennte auch dem referee nur eine vage Antwort geben - glaubst
     Du wirklich, dass der das _ganz_ genau wissen will? Am Ende will er
     dann wirklich, dass wir's ins paper reinschreiben.

FIXME: Das kann man machen, aber man sieht nicht wirklich mehr. 

%DM% schaut das dann "zu bunt" aus wie wir schreiben?

Ich moechte dafuer aber nicht noch ein Bild ins Paper geben. Was macht man da?

%DM% Das Argument kommt natürlich oft, vielleicht will man wirklich ein
     für alle mal ein Beispiel dafür bringen, dass continuous shading
     nix bringt. Uns ist es ja klar, aber den Lesern offenbar nicht.

All remaining minor points have been incorporated into the revised
manuscript.
