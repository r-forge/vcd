Dear David, Achim, and Kurt,

Please find enclosed a report on your CSC paper.
Thanks for contributing to the CSC.
Please tell us quickly when we can expect your revision.

Best regards,

Antony

PS The report takes a fairly hard line, but I think the  
recommendation is a good one.  Cut down on the simple introductory  
stuff and just show what can be done with visualization for a real  
multi-dimensional example.  That would make for a much more  
attractive and interesting paper.

Report on `Visualizing Multi-way Contingency Tables' by David Meyer,  
Achim Zeileis, and Kurt Hornik

In your response to this mail would you please indicate:

1.      When you will submit a revision?
(The deadline is April 10, 2006)
2.      Who will come to the CSC conference?
(Regarding the conference, please remember to register before the end  
of March.  The early registration fee will be refunded to authors.)

Answers to these points MUST be final since we are going into  
production mode both for the book and for the conference.

In your resubmission please give us your detailed remarks and  
responses to the points below.

General remarks:

The title of this paper promises a lot, but the paper sadly does not  
deliver.  It is not until p20 that multi-way tables are discussed.  A  
lot of the earlier material should be dispensed with and replaced by  
deeper analysis of a real multi-way example.

On p2 it says "Section 3 explains how the use of color in residual- 
based shadings can support data exploration, and even promotes the  
methods to diagnostic and model- based tools by visualizing test  
statistics and residuals of independence models."  That would be  
great if Section 3 did show that, but it only discusses two-way  
tables.  Why is there no discussion of using visualization to support  
more complicated modelling?

The name association plots implies they can only be used for  
association.  In generalised form they are a structured residual plot  
and could be used to display residual patterns from more complex  
models.  It could be good to make this more explicit and to give  
examples.  Friendly, Hofmann and Theus have all published material on  
various ways of using mosaic plots to display residuals and to  
support modelling.  There should be more discussion of this work too.

The authors' insistence that sieve plots are helpful is surprising.   
They are difficult to interpret and appear to have no advantages over  
the other two graphics used.  All the material on sieve plots could  
be dropped.  The advice on p10, repeated in the conclusions, as to  
when each of the three plots is useful is an assertion, for which the  
authors provide no evidence.

The discussion on colour (§3.1) is interesting, but very general, and  
the claims made are not backed up by any scientific evidence.  Since  
no colour printing is available for the book, this section should  
probably be shortened.

The first example is a strange choice.  It is very old, the data have  
been arbitrarily discretised (which would probably not be done  
nowadays), and, of course, both variables are ordinal.  On top of  
that it is not fully explained.  What is meant by a visit and what  
does regular mean?  The authors should use a more interesting and up- 
to-date example and treat it more briefly.

The hair/eye colour example introduces an extra variable, gender.   
The authors say this variable is artificial.  Why use artificial  
examples when there are so many real and interesting ones around?

p16-18 §3.3 is interesting on using permutation tests.  Linking  
graphics and statistical tests closely is a good idea.  An example  
showing how this generalises to multi-way tables would be very nice.

p17-18 Of course, fixed cut-off points are only crude guidelines.

p19 §3.4 Doesn't recommending perceptually uniform colours speak  
against sieve plots?

p19 §3.4 Very strong claims are made here based on one simple 2x2  
table.  A more complicated table should be analysed.

p25 An alternative to Figure 20 would be a Double Decker Plot of  
department by gender with accepted highlighted.  For a binary  
dependent variable, highlighting is always better than adding the  
dimension to a mosaic plot.
Not making clear that the Berkeley depts have different sizes can be  
misleading.  The argument here is weak.



Specific remarks:

p1 not necessarily a square, a rectangle  (see also p5)

p2 Section not Sect.

p3 Table 3 should have equal spacing

p4 Fig 1 is unfair, since a grouped barchart by rows would have shown  
the information

p5 Not necessarily a squared mosaic, not splits of a square

p10 tends to produce not tend

p11 break up HLS so that the text does not overrun the margin

p17 add a third piece of information to the plot

p17 in Section 3.1 (not in the Sect.)

p17 the the

p19 being conditionally independent

p20 barcharts on the diagonal (not in)
