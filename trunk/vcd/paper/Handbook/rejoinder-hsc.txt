1.      When you will submit a revision? (The deadline is April 10, 2006)
%Z% 2006-04-10 then, probably...

2.      Who will come to the CSC conference?
%Z% ...probably the first author?

Answers to these points MUST be final since we are going into  
production mode both for the book and for the conference.
%Z% good for us :-)

The title of this paper promises a lot, but the paper sadly does not  
deliver.  It is not until p20 that multi-way tables are discussed.  A  
lot of the earlier material should be dispensed with and replaced by  
deeper analysis of a real multi-way example.
%Z% Maybe we should change the title to `Visualizing Contingency Tables'?

On p2 it says "Section 3 explains how the use of color in residual- 
based shadings can support data exploration, and even promotes the  
methods to diagnostic and model- based tools by visualizing test  
statistics and residuals of independence models."  That would be  
great if Section 3 did show that, but it only discusses two-way  
tables.  Why is there no discussion of using visualization to support  
more complicated modelling?
%Z% ok, a 4-way or maybe 5-way example would be good, will check Andersen.

The name association plots implies they can only be used for  
association.  In generalised form they are a structured residual plot  
and could be used to display residual patterns from more complex  
models.  It could be good to make this more explicit and to give  
examples.  Friendly, Hofmann and Theus have all published material on  
various ways of using mosaic plots to display residuals and to  
support modelling.  There should be more discussion of this work too.
%Z% some references and a few comments will have to do here

The authors' insistence that sieve plots are helpful is surprising.   
They are difficult to interpret and appear to have no advantages over  
the other two graphics used.  All the material on sieve plots could  
be dropped.  The advice on p10, repeated in the conclusions, as to  
when each of the three plots is useful is an assertion, for which the  
authors provide no evidence.
%Z% Oh my, I do not think we have to provide evidence, we're giving a
%Z% survey only. Maybe we can shorten the sieve plots section and add
%Z% a critical remark that sieve plots are not always a good choice.

The discussion on colour (§3.1) is interesting, but very general, and  
the claims made are not backed up by any scientific evidence.  Since  
no colour printing is available for the book, this section should  
probably be shortened.
%Z% Not having color is plain ridiculous, of course. Could also be
%Z% an argument for sieve plots which do not depend as heavily on
%Z% on shading :-)
%Z% Honestly: Not having color is a problem!

The first example is a strange choice.  It is very old, the data have  
been arbitrarily discretised (which would probably not be done  
nowadays), and, of course, both variables are ordinal.  On top of  
that it is not fully explained.  What is meant by a visit and what  
does regular mean?  The authors should use a more interesting and up- 
to-date example and treat it more briefly.
%Z% I think this kind of data will still be encountered in practice
%Z% and shows some of the pitfalls. Another sentence of explanation
%Z% will probably do here.

The hair/eye colour example introduces an extra variable, gender.   
The authors say this variable is artificial.  Why use artificial  
examples when there are so many real and interesting ones around?
%Z% The referee has a point here, maybe we can find something better.

p16-18 §3.3 is interesting on using permutation tests.  Linking  
graphics and statistical tests closely is a good idea.  An example  
showing how this generalises to multi-way tables would be very nice.
%Z% as above: will try to find a 4-way example.

p17-18 Of course, fixed cut-off points are only crude guidelines.
%Z% not! Work much better than continuous shadings.

p19 §3.4 Doesn't recommending perceptually uniform colours speak  
against sieve plots?
%Z% ...or against publishing in a book on visualization that comes
%Z% in grey shades only?

p19 §3.4 Very strong claims are made here based on one simple 2x2  
table.  A more complicated table should be analysed.
%Z% Can't the referee count? It was 2x3 the last time I checked.
%Z% More seriously: The claims are made based on theory, the graphic
%Z% is an illustration only.

p25 An alternative to Figure 20 would be a Double Decker Plot of  
department by gender with accepted highlighted.  For a binary  
dependent variable, highlighting is always better than adding the  
dimension to a mosaic plot.
%Z% Very strong claims are made based on a simple 2x2x6 table...

Not making clear that the Berkeley depts have different sizes can be  
misleading.  The argument here is weak.
%Z% Yawn...


Specific remarks:

p1 not necessarily a square, a rectangle  (see also p5)

p2 Section not Sect.

p3 Table 3 should have equal spacing

p4 Fig 1 is unfair, since a grouped barchart by rows would have shown  
the information

p5 Not necessarily a squared mosaic, not splits of a square

p10 tends to produce not tend

p11 break up HLS so that the text does not overrun the margin

p17 add a third piece of information to the plot

p17 in Section 3.1 (not in the Sect.)

p17 the the

p19 being conditionally independent

p20 barcharts on the diagonal (not in)
