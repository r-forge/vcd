\title{Response to the referee}

\maketitle

First, we would like to thank the referee for his/her useful comments, 
they certainly led to an improvement of our work.

A major critique concerned the lack of convincing examples for
multiway-tables: we removed the (somewhat artificial) Hair/Eyecolor-data set, and added a
(real) fourway data set at the end. On the other hand, we think that a
handbook should discuss the basics as well, since a reader might not
be familiar with all concepts. Therefore, we led the introductory
section practically unchanged, except a critical note on the limited
use of sieve plots. Also, we do not mention sieve plots any more in
the other sections. 

We added the references for the multi-way
association plots and some explanations. In our examples, we stressed
the importance of highlighting in case of binary dependent variables.

Since color issues are important and rarely discussed in this context, we did not
shorten that section as suggested. We will provide the color figures on a
web site for people not having access to the electronic version of the handbook.
