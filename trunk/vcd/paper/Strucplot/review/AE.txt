AE report for JSS submission #203

This paper describes the vcd package that allows one through mosaic,
association and sieve plots to visualize multivariate categorical data.
The paper is well written and I would recommend to be tentatively
accepted. However, a minor revision is necessary before publication. The
following points need to be addressed in the revision:

(1) The structure of the paper could be improved. The various types
of plots used for visualizing multiway contingency tables should be 
introduced (their main features described and examples shown) in
the introductory section.

(2) At the end of the paper (new section) a more challenging data set
should be analyzed using the functionality of the package and the reader
be walked through this analysis.

(3) Computational/performance issues should be briefly addressed.

(4) All the comments raised in the referee's report should be addressed.
However, I find section 3.3 useful and would like the authors to keep it 
in its current form.
