  o motivation for computing with color spaces: color is an important tool
    for statistical graphics; omnipresent in electronic papers,
    presentation slides, software packages; however, little is published
    in the statistical literature on how you can compute with colors.
  o some background on color perception
  o description of important color spaces: RGB, HSV, CIEXYZ, CIELAB,
    CIELUV/HCL (possibly some remarks on HLS, CMYK)
      - properties/shape
      - advantages/disadvantages
      - conversions (incl. formulas), difficulties, etc.
  o applications: computing distances, mixing colors, selecting palettes
    along axes of color spaces, ...

For the color spaces part, I think that simply documenting what is already
in colorspace (plus some background info) should be very interestin. For
the applications, I could throw in the things we did for vcd and recycle
some stuff we've written in this report (which is not submitted in this
form)
