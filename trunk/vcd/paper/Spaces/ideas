  o set up SVN (for code and paper) at R-Forge [AZ]
  o collect color space visualizations [RI, PM, AZ]
  o collect color space conversion formulas
    (as implemented in colorspace) [RI]
  o collect applications and illustrations [RI, PM, AZ]
      
OUTLINE
  o motivation for computing with color spaces
      - color is an important tool for statistical graphics
      - omnipresent in (electronic) papers, presentation slides,
        software packages
      - however, little is published in the statistical literature on
        how you can compute with colors.
  o some background on color perception
  o description of important color spaces: RGB, HSV, CIEXYZ, CIELAB,
    CIELUV/HCL (possibly some remarks on HLS, CMYK)
      - properties/shape
      - advantages/disadvantages
      - conversions (incl. formulas), difficulties, etc.
  o applications:
      - computing distances
      - mixing colors
      - selecting palettes along axes of color spaces
      - ...
