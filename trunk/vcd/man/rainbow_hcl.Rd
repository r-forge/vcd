\arguments{
  \item{n}{the number of colors (\deqn{\ge 1}{>= 1}) to be in the palette.}
  \item{c}{chroma value in the HCL color description.}
  \item{l}{luminance value in the HCL color description.}
  \item{start}{the hue at which the rainbow begins.}
  \item{end}{the hue at which the rainbow ends.}
  \item{h}{hue value in the HCL or HSV color description, has to be
    in [0, 360] for HCL and in [0, 1] for HSV colors.}
  \item{s}{saturation value in the HSV color description.}
  \item{v}{value value in the HSV color description.}
  \item{correct}{control parameter for \code{heat_hcl} determining,
    how slowly colors should fade out.}
  \item{\dots}{Other arguments passed to \code{\link[colorspace]{hcl}}
    or \code{\link{hsv}}, respectively.}

\details{
  All functions compute palettes based on either the HCL or
  the HSV color space. \code{rainbow_hcl} computes a rainbow of colors
  defined by different hues given a single value of each chroma and luminance.
  It corresponds to \code{\link{rainbow}} which computes a rainbow in
  HSV space.
  
  Both functions, \code{diverge_hcl} and \code{diverge_hsv}, compute 
  a set of colors diverging from a neutral center (grey or white, without
  color) to two different extreme colors (blue and red by default). This
  is similar to \code{\link{cm.colors}}. For the diverging HSV colors,
  two hues \code{h} are needed, a maximal saturation \code{s} and a
  fixed value \code{v}. The saturation is then varied to obtain the
  diverging colors. For the diverging HCL colors, again two hues \code{h}
  are needed, a maximal chroma \code{chroma} and two luminances \code{l}.
  The colors are then created by linear interpolation between the 
  neutral color (with zero chroma and luminance \code{l[1]}) and 
  the full color (with chroma \code{c} and luminance \code{l[2]}).

  The palette \code{heat_hcl} gives an implementation of \code{\link{heat.colors}}
  in HCL space. By default, it goes from a red to a yellow hue, while
  simultaneously going to lighter colors (i.e., increasing luminance)
  and reducing the amount of color (i.e., decreasing chroma). Similarly,
  \code{decrease_hcl} gives a palette that goes from a fully saturated
  color (blue by default) to a lighter grey. This is essentially one branch
  of the \code{diverge_hcl} palettes.

  The diverging palettes are used for choosing the colors for mosaic 
  displays in \code{\link{mosaic}}.
