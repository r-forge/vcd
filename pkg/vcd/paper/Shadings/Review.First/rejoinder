Dear Luke,

we prepared a revision of our manuscript
  "Residual-based Shadings for Visualizing (Conditional) Independence"
according to your comments and the reviews of the two referees. Please
find attached a completely blinded (title and references), semi-blinded
(only title) and unblinded PDF version of the manuscript. The latter
two also include R code to reproduce the results and figures in the
paper.

The revision encompasses two main changes:

  - side-by-side graphs
    Figure 3 has been extended to illustrate the main points of the 
    paper. It shows both modifications (significance and colors)
    step by step: first a visualization of significance is added,
    then HCL instead of HSV colors are employed.
    This is demonstrated for two different contingency tables using
    a significant maximum-type test and a non-significant sum-of-squares
    test, respectively.

  - conditional independence examples
    The examples for conditional independence models were extended and
    the UCB admissions example was omitted. First, we illustrate a 
    shading corresponding to the double maximum test for a conditional
    4x3 table in 2 strata. Second, we illustrate a shading corresponding
    to the maximum of sum-of-squares test for a conditional 2x2 table
    in 9 (= 3x3) strata. Thus, the double maximum shading is used when
    the focus is on identifying cells in a larger table, and the maximum
    sum-of-squares shading is used when only the stratum can be identified
    (as there is only one degree of freedom in each conditional table,
    as correctly pointed out by the referees).
  
Some more details can be found in the point-to-point answers to the 
referees below. (One comment below includes R code that needs to be
eliminated if you decide to pass on the completely blinded instead of the
semi-blinded version of the paper.)

Best wishes,
Z

The usage of full-color and reduced-color palettes in 2-way tables has
been explained more clearly in Section 3 and two tables are used to 
bring out more clearly the benefits of the new shadings. In particular,
Figure 3 has several side-by-side mosaic plots (with legends) that
compare different shadings for significant and non-significant tests.

In Section 4, a better example (than UCB admissions) has been added that
explains how varying chroma levels can bring out strata-specific
independence.

As already explained above, the examples in Sections 3 and 4 have been
extended (or newly added) to address these points.

This is an interesting point and we have experimented with several
alternative strategies for choosing cut offs for test statistics other
than the maximum. It is clear that if we wish to mimic the behaviour of
the maximum shading, the cut offs always have to be outside the range
of residuals for non-significant tests and inside the range otherwise.
The problem is to find cut offs with an intuitive meaning if other test
statistics are used: it is always tempting to classify the colored
cells as significant (which is only true for the maximum statistic).

The strategy you describe above sometimes works well, but for some
tables it results in many colored cells in the plot. To avoid this,
one could always shade a certain share of the cells only.

We have added some discussion of such alternative strategies at the
end of Section 3.

We have extended Figure 3 for contrasting HSV-based and HCL-based 
shadings (both for the full-color and reduced-color palettes). This
shows in a practical example that the HCL colors are better belanced
and less flashy than the HSV colors from the Friendly shading.

Figure 2 is kept in the paper because it shows that walking along
simple paths through HCL palettes leads to more useful palettes
(in the sense above: balanced, less flashy). As both HSV and HCL
colors can also be represented in RGB (or HSV for that matter),
this is an important point because it is exactly the intuitive
interpretation of the dimensions that makes HCL more useful than
HSV.

For the full-color HCL palettes we have computed the representation
of the colors in HSV space:

HCL		 HSV
(260, 100, 50)   (232.2, 90.9, 76.4)
(260,  50, 72.5) (232.0, 54.7, 81.4)
(  0,	0, 95)   (  0.0,  0.0, 87.4)
(  0,  50, 72.5) (350.8, 59.9, 82.9)
(  0, 100, 50)   (350.7, 92.3, 64.9)

This shows that it would be very hard to choose balanced colors in
HSV space because saturation and value would have to be chosen very
differently for differing hues.

The two new examples in Section 4 have been chosen as to address this
point. It shows how both association and mosaic displays can be 
employed in a trellis layout and how color can bring out both
significance and dependence patterns in these more complex graphs.

It is now pointed out more clearly that conditional inference always
conditions on the observations (i.e., relies on the permutation 
distribution of the test statistics). The term `unconditional limiting
distribution' is used in contrast to the `conditional limiting
distribution'.

The most common terminology in the log-linear models literature is to
speak of various kinds of independence models even if homogeneity would
be more precise for many sampling schemes. Hence, we adopt this
terminology, but point out the relation to homogeneity in Section 2.1

> page 5, line 3: Standard errors for your p-values?

Estimated standard errors can be obtained using the formula
  sqrt(p * (1-p) / 5000)

In our case this gives
  Arthritis (X^2): 0.0008
  Arthritis (M): 0.0014
  Piston rings (X^2): 0.0036
  Piston rings (M): 0.0045
  Alzheimer (sum X^2): 0
  Alzheimer (max X^2): 0
  Alzheimer (max M): 0
  Punishment (sum X^2): 0.0002
  Punishment (max X^2): 0.0011
  Punishment (max M): 0.0011

> page 11, line 6: what does "most similar" mean?

A remark has been added to the paper: We use the are of the symmetric
difference in the chroma/luminance plane for assessing similarities
between hues.

Typically, users find it difficult to resolve chroma and luminance
differences (that are not very large). This is reinforced if there are many
colors and if the shaded areas are non-adjacent within the plotting region.
To illustrate this, we attach a PDF graphic to this rejoinder where we
used a continuous shading starting from (H, 50, 72.5) at 1.24 and reaching
(H, 100, 50) at 2 (corresponding roughly to the 99.99% quantile). Instead
of using this raw scale, we could also interpolate on the p value scale,
the resulting plot would be very similar. Starting from the R code from
the appendix, you can generate this graphic via

mosaic(art, gp = shading_hcl, gp_args = list(
  interpolate = function(x) ifelse(x >= 1.24, 1 + 0.5/(2 - 1.24) * (x - 2), 0),
  p.value = art_max$p.value))

Whereas it is relatively easy to compare the two blue cells, it
is much harder to resolve difference between the two red cells.
Also, it is difficult to pick up differences between red and blue cells.

All remaining minor points have been incorporated into the revised
manuscript.
