Dear Luke,

we prepared a revision of our manuscript
  "Residual-based Shadings for Visualizing (Conditional) Independence"
according to the comments of the referee. All three specific comments
have been fully included into the paper. Some of the general comments
are included as well in the paper and we provide some detailed replies
to all of them below.

I've put up a ZIP archive containing an unblinded and blinded version
of the paper at
  http://statmath.wu-wien.ac.at/~zeileis/shadings.zip

Best wishes,
Z

The corresponding mosaic plot has been added to Section 4. The
reason that we preferred to use the association plot in our previous
submission was the following: The largest Pearson residuals occur
in cells with small observed frequencies and this is brought out a
bit better by the association plot. However, the mosaic plot also 
visualizes different aspects of the data set and surely adds to the
intelligibility of the example. Our feeling is that the graphic is 
not absolutely necessary for the paper, but if the editors think it
important enough to justify an additional color page in the paper,
we are, of course, happy to include it.

Fixed by rotating the caption to conform with the orientation of the
figure.

Yes, of course, thanks for spotting this!

As argued at the end of Section 3.3, the cut-offs in the sum-of-squares
shading cannot convey significance, hence different palettes are
used to do this. It is true that readers, when exposed to these
shadings the first time, might find it difficult to judge significance.
It takes a certain time and effort to learn about them, but then
the palettes are typically easily recognized and it is easy to
distinguish between the bright fully-colored palette and the
reduced-color palette.

In a 2-way table, inclusion of the distribution of the first margin
does not impede interpretation of the conditional distribution of the
second margin. The conditional proportions are aligned along the same
axis and hence easily read off.
The same is not necessarily true in multi-way tables, depending on
the splitting order and direction which in turn depends on the
independence model that should be visualized.

This is a good point: Especially in higher-dimensional tables, the 
sum-of-squares statistic performs considerably better than the maximum
statistic for certain patterns of dependence while the converse is
true for other patterns. Therefore, we added some brief remarks at the end
of Section 2.1 that neither of the tests uniformly dominates the other
and that the reason for discussing the maximum test in some detail is
its appeal for visualization.
