COMMENTS FOR THE AUTHORS

The revision better highlights the utility of the approach.  
I have just a few specific comments/suggestions and 
a few general comments.

  It would be nice to include the shaded mosaic (as well 
as the association) plot for the 4-way table example.   
This would highlight the color scheme better.

  Orientation of Figure 3 does not correspond with description.

  I believe that Haberman (1937) p 11,  should read (1973).


General comments that authors may choose to comment on 
in the paper, or think about...

Sums of Squares Shading:
Arbitrary choice of cut-offs reduces the approach to ad hoc 
observation-shading approaches.  Relatedly, it is not clear 
that in isolation, the sums of squares shading won't 
lead the reader to see statistical significance where 
there is none.

Page 11. "This has also the advantage that only the conditional 
independence problem but  not the conditioning distribution over 
k = 1, . . . ,K is visualized which could obscure departures 
from conditional independence if the number of observations 
in each stratum n++k are very different."  --This makes me wonder 
why the focus is not generally on distribution homogeneity 
in the 2-way table case as well--why display the joint 
distribution when describing association? 

Use of maximum stat.  The power of the Max stat 
may be significantly lower 
than the power of the  X^2 (score) stat.  
How might this play a role in your 
graphical approach to diagnosing model fit?
